Description:

In one of my projects I found myself in the odd position where I had data in a YAML file, that needed some processing done on and then being inserted into a CoffeeScript file.

Now I could've just done a YAML to JSON conversion, but seeing as I had the intermediate Ruby processing steps and because I really wanted the output to be CoffeeScript as I was likely to have to work and manipulate it further later anyway, and would want to make changes to the CS directly instead of parsing the whole beast again.

So after loading the YAML into a Ruby hash and manipulating it appropriately I needed to do the conversion to CoffeeScript.

This is my solution:

usage:
    
  proc = Proc.new do |output| 
    coffee_script_file.puts output
  end

  HashToCs.convert(ruby_hash, "", proc)
